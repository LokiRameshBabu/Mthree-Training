# Linux Vim & Process Management Guide

## 1. About Vim
Vim (Vi IMproved) is a highly configurable text editor used for efficiently editing code and configuration files. It extends the functionalities of the original `vi` editor.

### **Why Use Vim?**
- Lightweight and fast
- Supports syntax highlighting
- Extensive plugin support
- Available on all Unix-based systems

## 2. Installing Vim on Different Operating Systems
### **Ubuntu/Debian**
```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt install vim -y
```

### **RPM-based Systems (CentOS, RHEL, Fedora, SUSE Linux)**
```bash
sudo yum install vim -y  # CentOS/RHEL 7
sudo dnf install vim -y  # RHEL 8/Fedora
sudo zypper install vim  # SUSE Linux
```

### **Amazon Linux**
```bash
sudo amazon-linux-extras enable vim
sudo yum install vim -y
```

### **Verify Installation**
```bash
vim --version
```

## 3. Vi Editor Modes
Vim operates in different modes:

| Mode | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Normal Mode** | Default mode; used for navigation and commands. |
| **Insert Mode** | Allows text input (`i` or `a` to enter). |
| **Visual Mode** | Used for selecting text (`v` to enter). |
| **Command Mode** | Used for saving, quitting, and searching (`:` to enter). |

### **Basic Commands:**
- Save: `:w`
- Quit: `:q`
- Save and Quit: `:wq` or `ZZ`
- Force Quit Without Saving: `:q!`

## 4. Linux Process Management Commands
### **Basic Commands to Monitor Processes:**
- List running processes:
  ```bash
  ps -e
  ```
- Display all processes (including those without a terminal):
  ```bash
  ps -ax
  ```
- Show detailed process information:
  ```bash
  ps -aux
  ```
- Full format listing:
  ```bash
  ps -ef
  ```
- Check memory usage:
  ```bash
  free -h
  ```
- Disk space usage:
  ```bash
  df -h
  ```
- Show active processes dynamically:
  ```bash
  top
  ```

### **Nice & Renice Commands**
- Set process priority:
  ```bash
  nice -n 10 command
  ```
- Change priority of a running process:
  ```bash
  renice -n 5 -p <PID>
  ```

### **Kill Commands**
- Terminate a process by PID:
  ```bash
  kill -9 <PID>
  ```
- Kill all processes with a specific name:
  ```bash
  pkill -9 process_name
  ```

## 5. Types of Processes
### **Parent-Child Process**
In Linux, a "parent-child process" refers to a relationship where one process (the "parent") creates a new, separate process (the "child") using the "fork()" system call; essentially, the child process is a copy of the parent at the time of creation, allowing them to run independently while sharing some information like memory space initially, with the parent process usually managing the lifecycle of the child process. 
#### Key points about parent-child processes:
- Creation with fork():
When a process calls "fork()", it creates a new child process that is almost identical to itself at that moment. 
- PID and PPID:
Each process has a unique Process ID (PID), and the child process inherits the Parent Process ID (PPID) from its parent. 
- Independent execution:
After forking, both the parent and child processes continue executing their code separately. 
- Managing child processes:
The parent process often needs to wait for the child process to finish using mechanisms like "wait()" or "waitpid()" to retrieve the child's exit status. 
#### Why use parent-child processes:
- Parallel processing:
Create multiple child processes to perform tasks concurrently, improving application performance. 
- Resource management:
A parent process can manage the resources used by its child processes, like memory allocation and file handling. 
- Daemon processes:
Many background services in Linux are implemented as daemon processes, which are typically created as child processes to detach from the controlling terminal.

  ```bash
  ps -ef --forest
  ```

### **Zombie & Orphan Processes**
In Linux, a "zombie process" is a child process that has finished executing but still remains in the system because its parent process hasn't acknowledged its termination, essentially "hanging around" as a leftover entry in the process table; while an "orphan process" is a child process whose parent process has died while it's still running, causing the system to reparent it to the "init" process (PID 1) which then manages its lifecycle. 
#### Key Differences:
- State:
A zombie process is a finished process waiting to be cleaned up, while an orphan process is still actively running. 
- Parent Responsibility:
A zombie process requires its parent to "reap" it using a wait() system call to remove it from the system, while an orphan process is automatically adopted by the "init" process which will eventually reap it when it finishes. 
Why are they problematic?
- Zombie Processes:
If a parent process doesn't properly handle its child processes, a large number of zombie processes can accumulate, taking up memory space in the system even though they are not actively doing anything. 
- Orphan Processes:
While not as directly problematic as zombies, a large number of orphan processes could potentially indicate issues with how processes are being spawned and managed. 

- Find zombie processes:
  ```bash
  ps aux | grep 'Z'
  ```

### **Daemon Process**
A process which runs in the background and is not interactive. They have no controlling terminal on their own from the user's perspective from the desktop. They continue to exist and operate regardless of any user being logged into the server if the computer is on.
#### Key points about daemons:
- Runs in background:
Unlike normal processes, a daemon doesn't have a controlling terminal and operates without user input. 
- System services:
Most essential system functions in Linux are implemented as daemons, like the network service "sshd" or the logging service "syslogd". 
- Starts on boot:
Daemons typically start automatically when the system boots up. 
- Forking process:
To create a daemon, a program usually "forks" itself, creating a child process that detaches from the parent and continues running in the background. 
- Example: `sshd`, `cron`, `nginx`
- View daemon processes:
  ```bash
  ps aux | grep 'daemon'
  ```

---

## 6. Process Creation in Linux
Processes are created using system calls like `fork()`, `exec()`, and `clone()`.
- Fork a new process:
  ```c
  pid_t pid = fork();
  ```
- Execute a new program:
  ```c
  execlp("/bin/ls", "ls", NULL);
  ```

---

## 7. Identifying & Sorting Processes
- Find process by name:
  ```bash
  pgrep process_name
  ```
- Sort processes by CPU usage:
  ```bash
  ps aux --sort=-%cpu | head -10
  ```
- Sort processes by memory usage:
  ```bash
  ps aux --sort=-%mem | head -10
  ```

---

## 8. States of Processes in Linux
| State | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **R (Running)** | Actively using CPU. |
| **S (Sleeping)** | Waiting for a resource. |
| **D (Disk Sleep)** | Uninterruptible sleep. |
| **T (Stopped)** | Process stopped or paused. |
| **Z (Zombie)** | Completed but not removed. |

- View process states:
  ```bash
  ps -eo pid,stat,cmd
  ```

## 9. Process Management in Linux
### **1. Initializing a Process**
In Linux, a process starts when a user runs a command or an application executes a program. The system assigns it a unique **Process ID (PID)** and a **Parent Process ID (PPID)**.

- When you open a terminal and run a command like:
  ```bash
  firefox &
  ```
  It runs the **firefox** process in the background.
- To check its PID:
  ```bash
  ps -e | grep firefox
  ```

### **2. Tracking Ongoing Processes**
- View all running processes:
  ```bash
  ps aux
  ```
- Display resource usage in real-time:
  ```bash
  top
  ```
- Filter processes by name:
  ```bash
  ps -ef | grep apache
  ```

### **3. Other Process Commands**
- **Kill a process by name:**
  ```bash
  pkill -9 firefox
  ```
- **Change process priority:**
  ```bash
  renice -10 -p 1234
  ```
- **Find the top 5 memory-consuming processes:**
  ```bash
  ps aux --sort=-%mem | head -5
  ```

### **4. Managing Linux Processes Efficiently**
- **Using Cron Jobs to Automate Tasks:**
  ```bash
  crontab -e
  0 2 * * * /home/user/backup.sh
  ```
- **Handling Daemon Processes:**
  ```bash
  systemctl status nginx
  ```
- **Managing Orphan and Zombie Processes:**
  - List zombie processes:
    ```bash
    ps aux | grep 'Z'
    ```
  - Reassign orphaned processes:
    ```bash
    nohup command &
    ```

## 10. Importance of Process Management
- Optimizes system performance.
- Prevents system hangs due to high CPU/memory usage.
- Helps in debugging and monitoring applications.
