## 4. Installing Software Packages on an EC2 Instance
A new EC2 instance has minimal software installed. You must install additional packages for specific tasks.

### Example: Installing Git
#### 1. Verify Installed Packages:
Run the following command to see installed packages:
```bash
sudo yum list installed
```
If Git is not installed, proceed with installation.

#### 2. Install Git:
```bash
sudo yum install git -y
```

#### 3. Configure Git:
Set up your Git username and email:
```bash
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"
```

#### 4. Clone a Repository:
Once Git is installed, you can clone a repository:
```bash
git clone <repo_url>
```
This downloads the repository to your EC2 instance.

## 5. Managing Files in Linux

### Creating Files
- Use the `touch` command to create a new file:
  ```bash
  touch filename.txt
  ```
- Use `nano` or `vim` to create and edit a file:
  ```bash
  nano filename.txt
  ```
  (Type content and press `CTRL+X`, then `Y`, then `ENTER` to save and exit.)

### Listing Files
- List all files in a directory:
  ```bash
  ls -l
  ```

### Deleting Files
- Remove a file:
  ```bash
  rm filename.txt
  ```
- Remove a directory and its contents:
  ```bash
  rm -r directory_name
  ```

### Copying Files
- Copy a file from source to destination:
  ```bash
  cp source_file.txt destination_directory/
  ```
- Copy a directory and its contents:
  ```bash
  cp -r source_directory/ destination_directory/
  ```

### Moving or Renaming Files
- Move or rename a file:
  ```bash
  mv old_filename.txt new_filename.txt
  ```
- Move a file to another directory:
  ```bash
  mv filename.txt /path/to/destination/
  ```

## 6. Difference Between Relative Path and Absolute Path
### **Relative Path**
- A **relative path** specifies a file or directory location **relative to the current directory**.
- Does not start with `/` (root directory).
- Example:
  ```bash
  cd Documents/project
  ```
  This moves into the `project` folder inside `Documents`, assuming you are already in `/home/user`.

### **Absolute Path**
- An **absolute path** specifies the complete location of a file or directory from the root (`/`).
- Always starts with `/`.
- Example:
  ```bash
  cd /home/user/Documents/project
  ```
  This moves directly to the `project` directory from any location.

**Key Difference:** Absolute paths are fixed locations, while relative paths depend on the current directory.

## Exercise:
### Navigating and Managing Directories
- Find your current location on the server:
  ```bash
  pwd
  ```
- Change directory to `/var/log`:
  ```bash
  cd /var/log
  ```
- Go back up a directory:
  ```bash
  cd ..
  ```
- Find your current location again:
  ```bash
  pwd
  ```
- List all the files in the current directory:
  ```bash
  ls
  ```
- List all files with detailed information:
  ```bash
  ls -l
  ```
- List files in long format, newest at the bottom:
  ```bash
  ls -ltr
  ```
- Change to the root directory:
  ```bash
  cd /
  ```
- Change back to your home directory:
  ```bash
  cd ~
  ```
- Go up a level in the directory structure:
  ```bash
  cd ..
  ```
- Find out more about the `ls` command:
  ```bash
  man ls
  ```
- Change to the `/var` directory:
  ```bash
  cd /var
  ```
- Show directory contents sorted by size in reverse order:
  ```bash
  ls -ltrS
  ```
- Find out the hardware version of your server:
  ```bash
  uname -i
  ```
- Save command history with a timestamped filename:
  ```bash
  history > name.YYMMDD.module2
  ```
