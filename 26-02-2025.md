# Linux Package Management Guide

## 1. Overview
Package management is essential for installing, updating, and removing software on Linux systems. Different distributions use different package managers:

| **Distribution** | **Low-Level Tool** | **High-Level Tool** |
|-----------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Debian (Ubuntu, Kali, etc.) | `dpkg` | `apt-get` / `aptitude` |
| Red Hat (CentOS, Amazon Linux) | `rpm` | `dnf` / `yum` |
| openSUSE | `rpm` | `zypper` |

---

## 2. Understanding Package Managers
A package manager automates the process of installing, upgrading, configuring, and removing software packages. It handles dependencies and ensures the software is correctly installed.

### **How Does a Package Manager Work?**
1. **Fetches the package** from a repository.
2. **Checks dependencies** and installs them if needed.
3. **Installs the package** into the system.
4. **Verifies package integrity** and provides version control.

---

## 3. Using `dnf` (For RHEL-based Distros)
Since Amazon Linux 2023 is based on RHEL, we use `dnf` for package management.

### **Check Available Commands**
```bash
dnf --help | grep list
```
- Displays available commands related to listing packages.

### **View Installed Repositories**
```bash
dnf repolist
```
- Lists enabled repositories that provide packages for installation.

### **List Installed Packages**
```bash
dnf list installed
```
- Shows all installed packages on the system.

### **Check if a Package is Installed**
```bash
dnf list installed | grep curl
```
- Checks if `curl` is installed on the system.

### **Search for a Package**
```bash
dnf search mariadb
```
- Searches for available `mariadb` packages in the repositories.

### **Check Dependencies of a Package**
```bash
dnf repoquery mariadb105 --deplist
```
- Lists dependencies required for `mariadb105` installation.

### **Install a Package**
```bash
sudo dnf install mariadb105 -y
```
- Installs `mariadb105`, adding `-y` to automatically confirm installation.

### **Verify Installation**
```bash
dnf list installed | grep mariadb
```
- Confirms whether `mariadb` is successfully installed.

### **Remove a Package**
```bash
sudo dnf remove mariadb105 -y
```
- Uninstalls `mariadb105` from the system.

### **Check for Updates**
```bash
dnf check-update
```
- Checks for available updates without installing them.

### **Update Installed Packages**
```bash
sudo dnf update -y
```
- Updates all installed packages to their latest available versions.

### **Why Install MariaDB?**
MariaDB is an open-source relational database management system (RDBMS), used as a drop-in replacement for MySQL. It is widely used for:
- Managing large datasets.
- Supporting web applications and dynamic websites.
- Storing structured information for business applications.
---

## 4. Adding a Repository
Sometimes, a package is available from a different repository. To install Terraform, we need to add HashiCorp's repo:
```bash
sudo dnf config-manager --add-repo https://rpm.releases.hashicorp.com/AmazonLinux/hashicorp.repo
```
- Adds HashiCorp’s repository to the package manager’s repository list.

### **Installing a Specific Version**
```bash
dnf list --showduplicates terraform
```
- Lists all available versions of Terraform.
```bash
sudo dnf install terraform-1.6.0-1
```
- Installs Terraform version `1.6.0-1`.

### **Downgrade a Package**
```bash
sudo dnf install terraform-1.5.0-1 --allowerasing
```
- Downgrades Terraform to `1.5.0-1`, allowing necessary dependency changes.

### **Upgrade a Package to the Latest Version**
```bash
sudo dnf update terraform
```
- Updates Terraform to the latest available version.

---

## 5. Upgrading the System
Upgrading refers to major system updates, such as moving to a new release version.

### **Upgrade to a New Release Version**
```bash
dnf upgrade --releasever=<version>
```
- Upgrades the system to a specific release version.

### **Reboot After System Upgrade**
```bash
sudo dnf system-upgrade reboot
```
- Restarts the system after a successful upgrade.

---

## 6. Installing Software Without a Package Manager
Not all software is available via package managers. Some are installed manually using compressed files like `.tar.gz`.

### **Example: Installing a Software from a Tarball**
```bash
wget https://example.com/software.tar.gz
```
- Downloads a software package from the internet.
```bash
tar -xvzf software.tar.gz
```
- Extracts the compressed software package.
```bash
cd software/
```
- Navigates into the extracted folder.
```bash
sudo mv software /usr/local/bin/
```
- Moves the software to `/usr/local/bin/` for system-wide execution.

Now the software can be used from anywhere in the terminal.

---

## 6. Installing Essential Packages
Apart from MariaDB, there are other important packages used frequently in Linux:

### **Common Essential Packages and Their Use Cases**
| Package | Use Case |
|---------|---------|
| `vim` | Advanced text editor with syntax highlighting. |
| `curl` | Transfers data from or to a server using protocols like HTTP, FTP. |
| `wget` | Downloads files from the internet. |
| `git` | Version control system for tracking changes in code. |
| `net-tools` | Provides tools like `ifconfig`, `netstat` for network management. |
| `htop` | Interactive process monitoring tool. |
| `tmux` | Terminal multiplexer to run multiple sessions. |
| `firewalld` | Manages firewall rules for system security. |

### **Install These Essential Packages**
```bash
sudo dnf install vim curl wget git net-tools htop tmux firewalld -y
```
- Installs multiple commonly used packages.

## 8. Service Management in Linux
### **Understanding systemd and systemctl**
- `systemd` is the system and service manager responsible for initializing the system and managing services.
- `systemctl` is the command-line tool used to manage services.
- `journalctl` is used for viewing logs related to systemd-managed services.

### **Checking the Status of systemd**
```bash
systemctl is-system-running
```
- Checks if systemd is running properly.

### **Listing and Searching Services**
```bash
systemctl list-units
```
- Lists all active services.
```bash
systemctl list-units | grep httpd
```
- Searches for a specific service (`httpd`).

### **Enable and Start a Service**
```bash
sudo systemctl enable httpd
sudo systemctl start httpd
```
- Ensures `httpd` starts automatically on boot and starts the service immediately.

### **Restart and Stop a Service**
```bash
sudo systemctl restart httpd
sudo systemctl stop httpd
```
- Restarts or stops the service as required.

### **Check the Status of a Service**
```bash
systemctl status httpd
```
- Displays whether the service is running, enabled, and recent log entries.

## 9. Creating a Custom Service
### **Step 1: Create a Script**
```bash
sudo vi /usr/local/bin/hello-world.sh
```
Add the following content:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
LOGFILE="/tmp/hello-world.log"
exec 3>>$LOGFILE
while true
do
  echo "writing to log file"
  echo "$(date): Hello World" >&3
  sleep 5
done
```
Make it executable:
```bash
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/hello-world.sh
```

### **Step 2: Create the Service Unit File**
```bash
sudo vi /etc/systemd/system/hello-world.service
```
Add the following content:
```ini
[Unit]
Description=Hello World Service

[Service]
ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/hello-world.sh
Type=simple
Restart=always
RestartSec=5

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

### **Step 3: Reload systemd and Start the Service**
```bash
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl start hello-world
sudo systemctl status hello-world
```

---

## 10. Viewing Logs with journalctl
### **View Logs of a Service**
```bash
sudo journalctl -u hello-world
```
- Displays logs related to `hello-world` service.

### **View Logs in Real-Time**
```bash
sudo journalctl -u hello-world -f
```
- Follows logs in real time.

### **View Logs for the Last 10 Minutes**
```bash
sudo journalctl -u hello-world --since "10 minutes ago"
```

### **Search Logs for Sudo Commands**
```bash
sudo journalctl _COMM=sudo
```
- Retrieves logs related to sudo commands.

---

## 11. Managing Log Files
### **Find Log Files in /tmp/**
```bash
sudo find /tmp/ -iname "*hello-world*"
```
- Searches for log files related to the service.

### **Find Open Files Using lsof**
```bash
sudo systemctl show -p MainPID hello-world
pgrep hello-world
sudo lsof -p $(pgrep hello-world)
```

### **Follow a Log File in Real-Time**
```bash
tail -f /tmp/hello-world.log
```
- Monitors changes to a log file as they occur.

---

## 12. Stopping and Disabling the Service
```bash
sudo systemctl stop hello-world
sudo systemctl disable hello-world
```
- Stops and disables the custom service.
