# DevOps, Terraform, and Ansible Basics

## Task Definition & Workflow
### Task Definition
A task definition is a blueprint that defines how a containerized application should run in a container orchestration environment like Amazon ECS. It specifies parameters such as container image, CPU/memory limits, networking, environment variables, and logging.

### Workflow
A basic DevOps workflow follows these steps:
1. **Code**: Developers write code and push it to a version control system (e.g., GitHub, GitLab).
2. **Build**: CI/CD tools (e.g., Jenkins, GitHub Actions) build and package the application.
3. **Test**: Automated testing ensures code quality.
4. **Deploy**: The application is deployed to servers or containers.
5. **Monitor**: Monitoring tools track application performance and security.

## What is a Cluster?
A cluster is a group of computers working together as a single system to provide high availability and scalability. Kubernetes, for example, uses clusters to manage containerized applications efficiently.

## Ansible Overview
### What is Ansible?
Ansible is an open-source automation tool used for configuration management, application deployment, and task automation. It simplifies IT processes by using YAML-based playbooks.

### How Does Ansible Help?
- **Automation**: Reduces manual configuration efforts.
- **Consistency**: Ensures uniform deployment across multiple servers.
- **Scalability**: Easily manages thousands of nodes.
- **Agentless**: No need to install agents on managed nodes.
- **Security**: Uses SSH-based communication without exposing credentials.

### How Does Ansible Work?
1. The **control node** runs Ansible commands and playbooks.
2. Managed nodes are defined in an **inventory file**.
3. **Modules** execute tasks on managed nodes via SSH.
4. **Playbooks** define automation workflows in YAML format.
5. Ansible applies configurations and executes commands as needed.

### Difference Between DevOps and SRE
| Feature | DevOps | Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) |
|---------|--------|---------------------------------|
| **Focus** | Development + Operations Collaboration | Reliability & Automation |
| **Key Tools** | CI/CD, Containers, IaC (Terraform) | Monitoring, Incident Response |
| **Automation** | Continuous Deployment | Self-healing systems |
| **Goal** | Faster Development and Deployment | Reduce Downtime and Improve Reliability |

### Ansible Architecture
- **Control Node**: The machine where Ansible is installed and managed.
- **Managed Nodes**: The servers configured by Ansible.
- **Inventory**: A list of managed nodes.
- **Playbooks**: YAML scripts defining automation tasks.
- **Modules**: Predefined functions that perform specific tasks.

### Installing Ansible on Linux
```sh
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y ansible
```
Verify installation:
```sh
ansible --version
```

### Basic Ansible Commands
```sh
# Check connectivity with managed nodes
ansible all -m ping

# Run a command on all nodes
ansible all -a "uptime"

# Apply a playbook
ansible-playbook playbook.yml
```

## YAML Files: Creation, Syntax, and How It Works
### What is a YAML File?
YAML (Yet Another Markup Language) is a human-readable data format used for configuration files. It is widely used in DevOps tools like Ansible, Kubernetes, and Terraform.

### How to Create a YAML File
1. Open a terminal or text editor.
2. Create a new file with a `.yaml` or `.yml` extension:
   ```sh
   touch config.yaml
   ```
3. Open the file and write YAML content.

### YAML Syntax and Rules
- **Indentation Matters**: Use spaces instead of tabs.
- **Key-Value Pairs**: Defined using `key: value` format.
- **Lists**: Represented using `-` (hyphen).
- **Dictionaries**: Nested key-value pairs.
- **Comments**: Use `#` for comments.

### Example YAML File
```yaml
name: John Doe
age: 30
skills:
  - DevOps
  - Kubernetes
  - Terraform
address:
  city: New York
  country: USA
```

### How YAML Works in DevOps
- **Ansible**: Uses YAML in playbooks to define automation tasks.
- **Kubernetes**: Uses YAML to define deployment configurations.
- **Terraform**: Uses YAML in provider configurations and state management.

## Terraform Overview
### What is Terraform?
Terraform is an Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool that allows users to define and provision infrastructure using declarative configuration files.

### Why Use Terraform?
- **Automation**: Deploy infrastructure automatically.
- **Scalability**: Manages cloud resources efficiently.
- **Multi-Cloud**: Works with AWS, Azure, GCP, and more.

### Installing Terraform
#### On Linux
```sh
sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y wget unzip
wget https://releases.hashicorp.com/terraform/1.5.0/terraform_1.5.0_linux_amd64.zip
unzip terraform_1.5.0_linux_amd64.zip
sudo mv terraform /usr/local/bin/
terraform --version
```

### Basic Terraform Commands
```sh
# Initialize Terraform
terraform init

# Plan infrastructure changes
terraform plan

# Apply changes
terraform apply -auto-approve

# Destroy infrastructure
terraform destroy -auto-approve
```

## Activity: Creating an EC2 Instance with Terraform
### Objective
The goal of this activity is to create an EC2 instance using Terraform and become comfortable with Infrastructure as Code.

### Steps
#### 1. Open AWS CloudShell
- Log in to the AWS Console.
- Search for **CloudShell** and open it.

#### 2. Install Terraform
- Follow the [official Terraform installation guide](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials/aws-get-started/install-cli) for **Amazon Linux**.

#### 3. Clone the Terraform Repository
```sh
git clone https://github.com/theacademy/sre-ec2-terraform.git
cd sre-ec2-terraform/terraform
```

#### 4. Modify Variables
- Open `variables.tf` and update `cohort_number` with your cohort number.
- Alternatively, override it when applying:
  ```sh
  terraform apply -var="cohort_number=c501"
  ```

#### 5. Initialize and Plan
```sh
terraform init
terraform validate
terraform plan
```

#### 6. Apply and Deploy
```sh
terraform apply
```

#### 7. Retrieve Private Key and Connect to EC2
```sh
terraform output -json | jq -r '.private_key.value' > private.pem
chmod 400 private.pem
ssh -i private.pem ec2-user@<public-ip-address>
```

### Cleanup
```sh
terraform destroy -auto-approve
```
