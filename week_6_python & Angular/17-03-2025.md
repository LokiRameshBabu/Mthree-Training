# 🐼 Pandas - Python Data Analysis Library

**Pandas** is a powerful and widely-used Python library for **data manipulation and analysis**. It offers data structures like **Series** and **DataFrame**, which are designed for handling tabular data and provide functionality similar to spreadsheets such as **Microsoft Excel** or **Google Sheets**.

Pandas integrates seamlessly with **NumPy** and offers a variety of tools for **data cleaning, aggregation, transformation**, and **visualization**, making it an essential tool for data scientists and analysts.

## 📘 Concept 1: Importing Pandas

Since Pandas is not a built-in Python library, we need to **import** it before using it in our code.

### ✅ Example 1: Importing with an Alias

It’s common to import Pandas using the alias `pd` to make the code shorter and more readable.

```python
import pandas as pd
```

From now on, we will use `pd` instead of typing `pandas` every time.

### 📝 Practice 1

The following code throws an error:

```python
df = pd.DataFrame({"A": [1, 2, 3], "B": [4, 5, 6]})
print(df)
```

> ❌ Error: `NameError: name 'pd' is not defined`

### ✅ Fix:

```python
import pandas as pd

df = pd.DataFrame({"A": [1, 2, 3], "B": [4, 5, 6]})
print(df)
```

### ✔ Output:
```
   A  B
0  1  4
1  2  5
2  3  6
```

---

## 📘 Concept 2: Creating a Series

A **Series** is a one-dimensional labeled array capable of holding data.

### ✅ Example:

```python
import pandas as pd

data = pd.Series([10, 20, 30, 40])
print(data)
```

### ✔ Output:
```
0    10
1    20
2    30
3    40
dtype: int64
```

---

## 📘 Concept 3: Creating DataFrames

A **DataFrame** is a two-dimensional labeled data structure (like a table).

### ✅ Example:

```python
import pandas as pd

data = {
    "Name": ["Alice", "Bob", "Charlie"],
    "Age": [25, 30, 35]
}

df = pd.DataFrame(data)
print(df)
```

### ✔ Output:
```
      Name  Age
0    Alice   25
1      Bob   30
2  Charlie   35
```

---

## 📘 Concept 4: Loading Data from Files

You can load data into a DataFrame from various file formats.

### ✅ CSV Example:

```python
import pandas as pd

df = pd.read_csv("data.csv")
print(df.head())
```

---

## 📘 Concept 5: DataFrame Indexing

You can access specific columns or rows using indexing.

### ✅ Example:

```python
import pandas as pd

df = pd.DataFrame({
    "Name": ["Alice", "Bob"],
    "Age": [25, 30]
})

print(df["Name"])
```

---

## 📘 Concept 6: DataFrame Slicing

Slicing allows you to access specific rows and columns.

### ✅ Example:

```python
import pandas as pd

df = pd.DataFrame({
    "A": [1, 2, 3, 4],
    "B": [5, 6, 7, 8]
})

print(df[1:3])
```

---

## 📘 Concept 7: Adding Columns and Rows

You can dynamically add new data to your DataFrame.

### ✅ Add a Column:

```python
df["C"] = [9, 10, 11, 12]
```

### ✅ Add a Row:

```python
new_row = {"A": 5, "B": 9, "C": 13}
df.loc[len(df)] = new_row
```

---

## 📘 Concept 8: Filtering, Sorting, and Updating DataFrames

### ✅ Filtering:

```python
filtered_df = df[df["A"] > 2]
```

### ✅ Sorting:

```python
df_sorted = df.sort_values(by="B", ascending=False)
```

### ✅ Updating:

```python
df.at[0, "A"] = 99
```

---

## 📘 Concept 9: Cleaning Data

### ✅ Handling Missing Data:

```python
df.dropna()       # Remove rows with missing values
df.fillna(0)      # Replace missing values with 0
```

---

## 📘 Concept 10: Descriptive Statistics

Pandas provides built-in methods for statistical operations.

```python
print(df.describe())
print(df.mean())
print(df.median())
```

---

## 📘 Concept 11: Grouping and Aggregation

Use `groupby()` to group and summarize data.

### ✅ Example:

```python
df = pd.DataFrame({
    "Department": ["HR", "HR", "IT", "IT"],
    "Salary": [40000, 45000, 60000, 65000]
})

grouped = df.groupby("Department").mean()
print(grouped)
```

---

## 📘 Concept 12: Plotting with Pandas

Pandas has built-in plotting support using Matplotlib.

### ✅ Example:

```python
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

df = pd.DataFrame({
    "Year": [2020, 2021, 2022],
    "Sales": [100, 150, 200]
})

df.plot(x="Year", y="Sales", kind="line")
plt.show()
```
