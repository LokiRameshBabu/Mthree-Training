# Angular Installation and Setup Guide

## ⚙️ How to Install Angular and Set Up Locally

Follow these steps to install Angular and start developing locally:

### Step 1: Install Node.js and npm
Angular requires Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager).

- Download and install Node.js from: [https://nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org)
- After installation, verify using:
  ```bash
  node -v
  npm -v
  ```

### Step 2: Install Angular CLI
Angular CLI (Command Line Interface) is a tool to initialize, develop, scaffold, and maintain Angular applications.

```bash
npm install -g @angular/cli
```

### Step 3: Create a New Angular Application

```bash
ng new my-angular-app
```
- You will be prompted to choose features like routing and stylesheet format.

### Step 4: Navigate to Your App Folder

## ✨ Why Do We Use AngularJS?

Although AngularJS (the original version) is now largely replaced by Angular, it was used because:

- It introduced **two-way data binding**, simplifying synchronization between model and view.
- **Dependency injection** made code more modular and testable.
- It was **ideal for building single-page applications (SPAs)**.
- **MVC architecture** improved application structure and scalability.

> 🔔 Note: Angular (version 2 and above) is the modern framework. AngularJS (version 1.x) is now in long-term support only.

## 💬 What Kind of Language is Used to Write Angular?

Angular applications are primarily written in:

- **TypeScript** (a superset of JavaScript that supports static typing, classes, and interfaces)
- **HTML** (for component templates)
- **CSS / SCSS / LESS** (for styling)

TypeScript makes code **more maintainable, scalable, and error-free**, which is one of the main reasons Angular adopted it as the standard language.
