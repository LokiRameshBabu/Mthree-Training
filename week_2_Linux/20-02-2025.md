# Linux Access Modes & File Permissions

## 1. Access Modes in Linux
Linux file permissions define how files and directories can be accessed by users. There are three primary access modes:

### **Read (r)**
- Allows viewing the contents of a file.
- For directories, enables listing the contents.
- Represented as `r` (4 in octal notation).

### **Write (w)**
- Allows modifying or deleting a file.
- For directories, enables creating or deleting files.
- Represented as `w` (2 in octal notation).

### **Execute (x)**
- Allows running a file as a program.
- For directories, enables accessing and entering the directory.
- Represented as `x` (1 in octal notation).

## 2. Access Levels in Linux
Each file and directory has three access levels:

| Access Level | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| **Owner** | The user who created the file and has full control. |
| **Group** | A set of users who share access to the file. |
| **Others** | All other users on the system. |

### Example:
To check file permissions, use:
```bash
ls -l filename
```
Example Output:
```
-rw-r--r-- 1 user group 1024 Feb 14 12:00 myfile.txt
```
Explanation:
- `rw-` → Owner has **read and write** access.
- `r--` → Group members have **read-only** access.
- `r--` → Others have **read-only** access.

---

## 3. Managing Permissions with `chmod`
`chmod` (change mode) is used to modify file permissions.

### **Using Symbolic Mode:**
- Add execute permission to the owner:
  ```bash
  chmod u+x filename
  ```
- Remove write permission for others:
  ```bash
  chmod o-w filename
  ```
- Give read and write permissions to the group:
  ```bash
  chmod g+rw filename
  ```

### **Using Numeric Mode:**
Permissions are represented as numbers:
- **4** → Read (r)
- **2** → Write (w)
- **1** → Execute (x)

Combine these values:
- `chmod 755 filename` (Owner: read, write, execute; Group/Others: read, execute)
- `chmod 644 filename` (Owner: read, write; Group/Others: read-only)

### **Cheat sheet for numerc modes:**
- rw - 6
- wx - 3
- rwx -7
- rx -5
- null - 0

## 4. Changing File Ownership with `chown`
`chown` (change owner) modifies file ownership.

- Change the owner of a file:
  ```bash
  chown newuser filename
  ```
- Change owner and group:
  ```bash
  chown newuser:newgroup filename
  ```
- Change ownership recursively:
  ```bash
  chown -R newuser:newgroup directory/
  ```

---

## 5. Changing Group Ownership with `chgrp`
`chgrp` (change group) changes the group ownership of a file.

- Change the group of a file:
  ```bash
  chgrp newgroup filename
  ```
- Change group recursively:
  ```bash
  chgrp -R newgroup directory/
  ```

## 6. Editing Files with Vim
Vim is a powerful text editor used for editing configuration files, scripts, and documents.

### Opening a File in Vim:
```bash
vim filename
```

### Important Vim Commands:
| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `i` | Insert mode (start editing) |
| `ESC` | Exit insert mode |
| `:w` | Save the file |
| `:q` | Quit Vim |
| `:wq` | Save and quit |
| `:q!` | Quit without saving |
| `dd` | Delete the current line |
| `yy` | Copy (yank) the current line |
| `p` | Paste after the current line |
| `/word` | Search for "word" in the file |

---

## 7. Special Operators in Linux (`|` Pipe Operator)
The `|` (pipe) operator is used to pass the output of one command as input to another command.

### Examples:
- List files and search for `.txt` files:
  ```bash
  ls -l | grep ".txt"
  ```
- Display running processes and filter by user `john`:
  ```bash
  ps aux | grep john
  ```
- Count the number of lines in a file:
  ```bash
  cat filename | wc -l
  ```

**Explanation:**
- `ls -l` lists files in long format.
- `grep` searches for a specific pattern in the output.
- `wc -l` counts the number of lines in a file.

## 8. Linux File Navigation
- Check the current version of Linux:
  ```bash
  uname -a
  ```
- Check your current location in the folder structure:
  ```bash
  pwd
  ```
- Move up one folder:
  ```bash
  cd ..
  ```
- Check your location again:
  ```bash
  pwd
  ```
- List all the files with details:
  ```bash
  ls -l
  ```
- List all files in reverse order:
  ```bash
  ls -ltr
  ```
- Change directory to the root folder:
  ```bash
  cd /
  ```
- Check your location again:
  ```bash
  pwd
  ```
- List all files sorted by most recently changed:
  ```bash
  ls -ltr
  ```
- Change back to your home directory:
  ```bash
  cd ~
  ```
- List all files, including hidden files:
  ```bash
  ls -ltra
  ```
- Run the command history:
  ```bash
  history
  ```

## 9. Example Use Cases
1. Make a script executable:
   ```bash
   chmod +x script.sh
   ```
2. Give full access to the owner and read access to others:
   ```bash
   chmod 744 myfile.txt
   ```
3. Assign ownership to a new user:
   ```bash
   chown john myfile.txt
   ```
4. Change group ownership of all files in a directory:
   ```bash
   chgrp developers /var/www/
   ```

  jobs
  ```
- Bring a background job to the foreground:
  ```bash
  fg %job_id
  ```
- Send a job to the background:
  ```bash
  bg %job_id
  ```

### **Process Monitoring and Exit Codes:**
- Trace system calls made by a process:
  ```bash
  strace -p <pid>
  ```
- Check the exit code of the last executed command:

## 12. OSI Model Layers
The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model consists of seven layers:

1. **Physical Layer** – Handles raw data transmission.
2. **Data Link Layer** – Manages MAC addresses and error correction.
3. **Network Layer** – Routes data packets (IP addresses).
4. **Transport Layer** – Provides reliable data transmission (TCP/UDP).
5. **Session Layer** – Manages session control between applications.
6. **Presentation Layer** – Converts data formats for applications.
7. **Application Layer** – User-facing applications (HTTP, FTP, DNS).

# 🧪 Activity: File Systems in Linux

## Completion Requirements
In this activity, you will use Linux to examine your system and individual file storage, as well as compress files you create.

### **Setup an EC2 Instance**
Use an **Amazon Linux EC2 instance** to complete this activity.

### **Step 1: Creating a Memory Report Folder**
```bash
mkdir memory_report
cd memory_report
```

### **Step 2: Listing Files by Size**
- List all files in the home folder, sorted by size (largest first):
  ```bash
  du ~ -a | sort -k1,1nr > homefiles_sorted.txt
  less homefiles_sorted.txt
  ```
- Repeat the task for all files on the system:
  ```bash
  sudo du / -a | sort -k1,1nr > allfiles_sorted.txt
  less allfiles_sorted.txt
  ```

### **Step 3: Checking File Sizes**
- Check the actual sizes used:
  ```bash
  du . -ha
  ```
- Check the apparent sizes:
  ```bash
  ls -la
  ```

### **Step 4: Checking File System Storage**
- Save the results to a file:
  ```bash
  df -h > filesystems.txt
  ```
- Examine the file:
  ```bash
  cat filesystems.txt
  ```

### **Step 5: Creating a Tar Archive**
- Create a tarball of `.txt` files:
  ```bash
  tar -cvf memory.tar *.txt
  ```
- List files inside the tar:
  ```bash
  tar -tvf memory.tar
  ```

### **Step 6: Compressing the Tar File**
- Compress the tar file using `gzip`:
  ```bash
  gzip memory.tar
  ```
- Check storage usage:
  ```bash
  du . -ha
  ```

### **Step 7: Decompressing and Extracting Files**
- Remove original files and check storage:
  ```bash
  rm *.txt
  du . -ha
  ```
- Decompress and extract:
  ```bash
  gunzip memory.tar.gz
  tar -xvf memory.tar
  du . -ha
  ```

### **Step 8: Creating a Compressed Tarball Directly**
- Create and extract a `.tar.gz` archive:
  ```bash
  tar -czvf memory.tar.gz *.txt
  du . -ha
  tar -xzvf memory.tar.gz
  du . -ha
  ```

# Managing Jobs in Linux
A **Linux job** is a task managed by a shell (e.g., Bash or Zsh). Jobs can run in the **foreground**, **background**, or as **detached sessions**.

## **1. Foreground and Background Jobs**
- Run a command in the foreground:
  ```bash
  sleep 60
  ```
- Run a command in the background:
  ```bash
  sleep 200 &
  ```
- List running background jobs:
  ```bash
  jobs
  ```
- Suspend a job (Ctrl+Z) and check status:
  ```bash
  sleep 50
  # Press Ctrl+Z
  jobs
  ```

## **2. Managing Background Jobs**
- Resume a job in the background:
  ```bash
  bg %1
  ```
- Bring a job back to the foreground:
  ```bash
  fg %1
  ```
- Kill a job:
  ```bash
  kill %1
  ```

## **3. Using `screen` to Run Persistent Jobs**
- Start a `screen` session:
  ```bash
  screen
  ```
- Run a command and detach the session:
  ```bash
  while true; do echo "Running..."; sleep 5; done
  ```
  **Detach with:** `Ctrl+A, D`
- List active screen sessions:
  ```bash
  screen -list
  ```
- Reattach to a screen session:
  ```bash
  screen -r <session_id>
  ```
- Close a screen session:
  ```bash
  screen -X -S <session_id> quit
  ```

# Job Statuses
| Status | Description |
|---------|------------|
| **Running** | The job is actively running in the foreground or background. |
| **Stopped** | The job was paused (Ctrl+Z). |
| **Exited** | The job has completed execution. |
| **Terminated** | The job was forcefully killed (Ctrl+C). |
| **Background** | The job is running in the background. |
| **Foreground** | The job is actively running in the terminal. |
