# Linux Disk Space & Scheduling Guide

## 1. Disk Space Management
Disk space management is crucial for system performance and preventing storage-related issues. Linux provides several commands to check and manage disk usage.

### **Check Disk Usage**
- Display disk space usage:
  ```bash
  df -h
  ```
- Check inode usage:
  ```bash
  df -i
  ```

### **Check Directory Size**
- Show disk usage of files and directories:
  ```bash
  du -sh /path/to/directory
  ```
- Display the top 10 largest directories:
  ```bash
  du -ah / | sort -rh | head -10
  ```

## 2. File Compression & Decompression
Linux provides various tools to compress and decompress files to save disk space.

### **Gzip & Gunzip**
- Compress a file using `gzip`:
  ```bash
  gzip filename
  ```
- Decompress a file using `gunzip`:
  ```bash
  gunzip filename.gz
  ```

### **Tar Archives**
- Create a `.tar` archive:
  ```bash
  tar -cvf archive.tar /path/to/files
  ```
- Extract a `.tar` archive:
  ```bash
  tar -xvf archive.tar
  ```
- Create a compressed `.tar.gz` archive:
  ```bash
  tar -czvf archive.tar.gz /path/to/files
  ```
- Extract a `.tar.gz` archive:
  ```bash
  tar -xzvf archive.tar.gz
  ```

## 3. Getting Started with Scheduling
If you are using an Amazon Linux 2 instance, you must install cron before running scheduled tasks.

### **Install Cron on Amazon Linux 2**
```bash
sudo yum update
sudo yum install cronie
sudo systemctl start crond
sudo systemctl enable crond
sudo systemctl status crond
```
##  Additional Topics from Scheduling and Automation
The uploaded document covers scheduling and automation topics, including:
- **Scheduling Tasks**: Automating routine system tasks.
- **Automating Tasks with Linux**: Using cron jobs and scripts.
- **Date in Linux**: Manipulating and formatting dates.
- **Arithmetics in BASH**: Performing calculations in shell scripts.
- **Scripting Commands**: Writing and executing shell scripts efficiently.

## 4. Scheduling Tasks in Linux
### **Cron Jobs**
`cron` is a time-based job scheduler in Unix-like operating systems.

#### **Writing a Cron Job**
To edit cron jobs:
```bash
crontab -e
```

#### **Cron Job Syntax**
```
* * * * * command_to_execute
| | | | |
| | | | ----- Day of the week (0 - 7, Sunday=0/7)
| | | ------- Month (1 - 12)
| | --------- Day of the month (1 - 31)
| ----------- Hour (0 - 23)
------------- Minute (0 - 59)
```

#### **Example Cron Jobs**
- Run a script every day at midnight:
  ```bash
  0 0 * * * /path/to/script.sh
  ```
- Run a command every 5 minutes:
  ```bash
  */5 * * * * /path/to/command
  ```
- Run a script at 3 AM on Sundays:
  ```bash
  0 3 * * 0 /path/to/script.sh
  ```

##  Cron Job Scheduling
In this activity, we will practice writing cron jobs using the `fixGenerator.sh` script.

### **Cron Job Examples**
- Run the script Mondayâ€“Friday at 6 AM:
  ```bash
  0 6 * * 1-5 /home/user/fixGenerator.sh
  ```
- Run the script at 6 PM every Friday:
  ```bash
  0 18 * * 5 /home/user/fixGenerator.sh
  ```
- Run the script every half hour from 9 AM to 4 PM on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday:
  ```bash
  */30 9-16 * * 1,3,5 /home/user/fixGenerator.sh
  ```
- Run the script every other hour every day:
  ```bash
  0 */2 * * * /home/user/fixGenerator.sh
  ```
- Run the script on May 4th at midday:
  ```bash
  0 12 4 5 * /home/user/fixGenerator.sh
  ```
- Run the script on the 1st of every month at 6:25 AM:
  ```bash
  25 6 1 * * /home/user/fixGenerator.sh
  ```
- Run the script every 20 minutes every Tuesday between 10 AM and 2 PM:
  ```bash
  */20 10-14 * * 2 /home/user/fixGenerator.sh
  ```
- Run the script on the 1st of every other month on the hour:
  ```bash
  0 * 1 */2 * /home/user/fixGenerator.sh
  ```
- Run the script at 6 AM and 8 AM on Saturdays and Sundays:
  ```bash
  0 6,8 * * 6,7 /home/user/fixGenerator.sh
  ```
- Copy the contents of your crontab into a file and save it to the `scripts` directory:
  ```bash
  crontab -l > ~/scripts/cron_backup.txt
  ```

## 5. Arithmetic Operations in Bash
Bash supports basic arithmetic operations using the `expr` command or `$(( ))` syntax.

### **Examples**
- Addition:
  ```bash
  echo $((5 + 3))
  ```
- Subtraction:
  ```bash
  echo $((10 - 2))
  ```
- Multiplication:
  ```bash
  echo $((4 * 5))
  ```
- Division:
  ```bash
  echo $((20 / 4))
  ```

## 6. Using `awk` for Text Processing
`awk` is a powerful text processing tool in Linux.

### **Basic `awk` Syntax**
```bash
awk '{print $1, $3}' file.txt
```
This prints the first and third columns from `file.txt`.

### **Example Use Cases**
- Print all lines containing "error":
  ```bash
  awk '/error/ {print $0}' logfile.txt
  ```
- Calculate the sum of numbers in the second column:
  ```bash
  awk '{sum+=$2} END {print sum}' data.txt
  ```

## 7. Activity: File Management and Git
### **Part A: Managing Files and Folders**
In this activity, we will create folders and files on the remote server.

1. **Create a folder in your home directory using your name:**
   ```bash
   mkdir myname
   ```
2. **Move to this folder:**
   ```bash
   cd myname
   ```
3. **Create an empty file:**
   ```bash
   touch file.txt
   ```
4. **Create a new folder in the same location called `myfolder`:**
   ```bash
   mkdir myfolder
   ```
5. **Move the empty file to the new folder:**
   ```bash
   mv file.txt myfolder/
   ```
6. **Create a backup of your file:**
   ```bash
   cp -p myfolder/file.txt file.bkp
   ```
7. **Remove the `myfolder` directory:**
   ```bash
   rm -rf myfolder
   ```
8. **Go back to your home directory:**
   ```bash
   cd ~
   ```

### **Part B: Working with Git**
Now that we can create folders and files, let's clone a Git repository and work with files in a local copy of the repository.

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/TheAcademy/pss-orderbook-deploy/
   ```
2. **Navigate to the cloned directory:**
   ```bash
   cd pss-orderbook-deploy
   ```
3. **Go to the activity folder:**
   ```bash
   cd src/linux_activities/Activity2
   ```

### **Searching Files**
1. **Display the contents of the file `stock_investments.txt`:**
   ```bash
   cat stock_investments.txt
   ```
2. **Display the first five lines:**
   ```bash
   head -5 stock_investments.txt
   ```
3. **Display the last five lines:**
   ```bash
   tail -5 stock_investments.txt
   ```
4. **Count the lines containing "GOOG":**
   ```bash
   grep GOOG stock_investments.txt | wc -l
   ```
5. **Count the lines containing "T":**
   ```bash
   grep -wc T stock_investments.txt
   ```
6. **Find files containing "SPY" (case insensitive):**
   ```bash
   grep -lir spy .
   ```
7. **Find files that do not contain "spy":**
   ```bash
   grep -lvri spy .
   ```
8. **Find all files containing "data" in their name:**
   ```bash
   find . -type f -name '*data*'
   ```
9. **Find folders named "error":**
   ```bash
   find . -type d -name error
   ```
10. **Change permissions on files containing "data" to be read-only for group and others:**
    ```bash
    sudo find . -type f -name "*data*" -exec chmod 744 {} \;
    ```
11. **Remove write permission for all users on `WFC/data.txt`:**
    ```bash
    chmod -w WFC/data.txt
    ```
