## 3. Initial Git Configuration
After installing Git Bash, you need to configure it for first-time use.

### Step 1: Set Up User Name and Email
The email and username which is associated with current github account
```bash
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"
```

### Step 2: Verify Configuration
```bash
git config --list
```
This command will display your Git settings.

### Step 3: Initialize a Git Repository
Navigate to a project folder and initialize Git:
```bash
cd path/to/your/project
git init
```

### Step 4: Check Git Version
Ensure Git is installed and working correctly:
```bash
git --version
```
### Step 5: Create a New Directory
To create a new directory and navigate into it:
```bash
mkdir my-git-project
cd my-git-project
```

## 4. Cloning a Repository
To clone a remote repository, use:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git
```

---

## 5. Creating and Committing Files
1. Create a new file:
```bash
echo "# My First Git Repo" > filename.txt
touch filename.txt
```
2. Add the file to Git:
```bash
git add filename.txt
```
3. Commit the file:
```bash
git commit -m "Initial commit"
```
4. Want to insert data into the file:
   
```bash
vi filename.txt
```
- To save & quit : **esc :wq**
- To quit : **esc :q**

---

## 6. Pushing Changes to GitHub
To push changes to a remote repository:
```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

---

## 7. Additional Git Commands
- **Check Status:**
```bash
git status
```
- **View Commit History:**
```bash
git log --oneline
```
- **Create a New Branch:**
```bash
git branch new-branch
```
- **Switch Branches:**
```bash
git checkout new-branch
```
- **Merge Branches:**
```bash
git merge new-branch
```
- ** Checking Git History:**
To view commit history:
```bash
git log
```
To see a concise version of commit history:
```bash
git log --oneline --graph --decorate
```
To check changes made in the repository:
```bash
git diff
```
- **To check the current path:**
  ```bash
  pwd
  ```

## 8. Learn Git Branching Activity

### Creating and Selecting Branches
To create a new branch and switch to it:
```bash
git branch feature-branch
git checkout feature-branch  # OR use: git switch feature-branch
```
### Why Use Branching?
Branching allows multiple developers to work on different features or fixes without affecting the main codebase. It helps in:
- **Isolating features**: Developers can work independently.
- **Testing without breaking main**: Changes can be tested before merging.
- **Collaborating efficiently**: Different teams can work on separate features simultaneously.

### Optional: Deleting a Branch
To delete a local branch:
```bash
git branch -d feature-branch
```
To delete a remote branch:
```bash
git push origin --delete feature-branch
```

### Check the Contents of a Branch
To list all branches and see the current one:
```bash
git branch -a
```

---

## 9. Pushing and Sharing Branches
To push a branch to a remote repository:
```bash
git push origin feature-branch
```
To share your branch with collaborators:
```bash
git fetch origin
```

## 10. Generating a Personal Access Token in GitHub
A **Personal Access Token (PAT)** is used instead of a password for authentication when using Git over HTTPS.

### Why Use a Personal Access Token?
- More secure than using passwords.
- Required for GitHub API access and integrations.
- Avoids frequent re-authentication issues.

### How to Generate a Personal Access Token:
1. Go to **GitHub > Settings > Developer settings > Personal access tokens**.
2. Click **Generate new token**.
3. Select the required scopes (e.g., `repo` for repository access).
4. Copy and save the token securely (it wonâ€™t be shown again).
5. Use the token instead of a password when authenticating:
```bash
git push https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git
```
When prompted for a password, enter the token instead.

---

## 11. Merging Your Branch Back into Main
To merge changes from a feature branch into `main`:
```bash
git checkout main
git merge feature-branch
```
If there are conflicts, resolve them manually, then commit the changes.

---

## 12. Pull Requests
A **Pull Request (PR)** is used to request merging changes into a shared repository.

### Steps to Create a Pull Request:
1. Push your branch to GitHub.
2. Go to your repository on GitHub.
3. Click **New Pull Request**.
4. Compare changes and add comments if necessary.
5. Click **Create Pull Request**.
