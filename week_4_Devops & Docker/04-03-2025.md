# Docker README

## What is Docker?
Docker is an open-source platform that enables developers to build, ship, and run applications in isolated environments called containers. It provides a lightweight and consistent runtime environment, ensuring applications work seamlessly across different systems.

## Why Use Docker?
- **Portability**: Applications can run consistently across various environments.
- **Scalability**: Easily scale applications using container orchestration tools like Kubernetes.
- **Efficiency**: Reduces resource usage compared to traditional virtual machines.
- **Faster Deployment**: Allows rapid application development and deployment with pre-built images.
- **Isolation**: Each container runs independently, reducing dependency conflicts.

## Key Docker Concepts
### Containers
Containers are lightweight, standalone, and executable software packages that include everything needed to run an application (code, runtime, libraries, and dependencies). They ensure that software runs reliably when moved from one environment to another.

### Volumes
Volumes are storage mechanisms that allow persistent data to be maintained even when containers stop or restart. They are used to store data outside the container's filesystem.

### Runtime
Docker runtime is the component responsible for executing and managing containers. It ensures that containers run in an isolated and secure environment.

## Installation of Docker
### Installing Docker on Ubuntu
1. **Update the package list**
   ```sh
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt upgrade -y
   ```
2. **Install required dependencies**
   ```sh
   sudo apt install -y apt-transport-https ca-certificates curl software-properties-common
   ```
3. **Install Docker**
   ```sh
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install -y docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io
   ```
4. **Verify installation**
   ```sh
   docker --version
   ```

## Connecting Docker to an AWS Ubuntu EC2 Instance
1. **Launch an EC2 Instance**
   - Go to AWS Management Console
   - Select **EC2** â†’ **Launch Instance**
   - Choose **Ubuntu** as the AMI
   - Configure security groups to allow SSH (port 22)

2. **Connect to the EC2 Instance**
   ```sh
   ssh -i your-key.pem ubuntu@your-ec2-instance-ip
   ```

3. **Install Docker on EC2** (Follow the same steps as the Docker installation guide above)

4. **Enable Docker Service**
   ```sh
   sudo systemctl enable docker
   sudo systemctl start docker
   ```

5. **Run a Test Container**
   ```sh
   sudo docker run hello-world
   ```

- Key features of Jenkins, including pipelines and plugins
- Creating and configuring a Jenkins job
- Best practices for using Jenkins, including version control and testing

## What is Jenkins and why is it used?
Jenkins is a well-known, open-source automation server used to automate many steps in the software development life cycle, including creating, testing, and deploying software. Software development teams often use Jenkins to automate their continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) procedures.

## Key Features of Jenkins
| Feature           | Description |
|------------------|-------------|
| Pipelines         | Jenkins makes it possible for users to refer to the build and deployment pipelines as pieces of code, facilitating version control, and guaranteeing CI/CD compliance. |
| Plugins           | To increase Jenkins's capability, numerous plugins have been produced. These plugins allow Jenkins to integrate with a variety of programs, including GitHub, Jira, and Docker. |
| Distributed Builds| Jenkins can be set up to perform builds on several agents or nodes, allowing the user to distribute builds over different machines and scale the CI/CD workflows as necessary. |

## Creating and Configuring a Jenkins Job
### Activity Steps:
1. Log in to the Jenkins server and navigate to the Jenkins dashboard.
2. Create a new Jenkins job by clicking **"New Item"** in the Jenkins dashboard.
3. Give your new job a name and select **"Pipeline"** as the job type, then click **"OK"** to continue.
4. Under **"Pipeline Definition,"** select **"Pipeline script"** as the definition.
5. In the **"Pipeline script"** box, define a simple pipeline with one stage. For example:

```groovy
pipeline {
    agent none
    stages {
        stage('Hello') {
            steps {
                echo 'Hello World'
            }
        }
    }
}
```

This script creates a new Jenkins job and configures the job to run a simple script that prints "Hello World."

6. Save your changes and run the job by clicking **"Build Now."** The output will verify that the pipeline is working properly.
7. Once the job has run successfully, edit the pipeline script to add additional stages and steps.
8. Save the changes and run the job again.
9. If there are any errors, troubleshoot the pipeline script and fix any issues.
10. Experiment with additional stages and steps to further customize the pipeline to your needs if it is running successfully.

### Example: A More Advanced Pipeline Script
```groovy
pipeline {
    agent none
    stages {
        stage('Hello') {
            steps {
                echo 'Hello World'
            }
        }
        stage('Birth') {
            steps {
                echo 'Welcome to the world!'
            }
        }
        stage('Education') {
            steps {
                echo 'Learn, grow, and develop new skills.'
            }
        }
        stage('Career') {
            steps {
                echo 'Find your passion and pursue a fulfilling career.'
            }
        }
        stage('Retirement') {
            steps {
                echo 'Relax, enjoy the fruits of your labor, and reflect on a life well-lived.'
            }
        }
    }
}
```
