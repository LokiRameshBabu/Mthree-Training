## ✅ Activity 1: Grepping Kubectl Logs

### 📄 Completion Requirements
Application logs provide valuable information about application behavior. They include categories such as:
- Warnings
- Info
- Error
- Debug

Kubernetes runs containers inside pods. You can access logs using:

```bash
kubectl logs <args>
```

This activity includes:
- Learning `kubectl` log commands.
- Performing search operations on logs.

---

### 📦 Kubectl Setup

#### Install and Configure Kubectl (Linux)
Visit [https://k8slogin.computerlab.online/](https://k8slogin.computerlab.online/) to:
- Download `kubectl`
- Configure using a signed certificate  
Login with your GitHub used in Kubernetes cluster.

---

### 📘 Kubectl Commands

```bash
# List all namespaces
kubectl get ns

# List all pods in a namespace
kubectl get pods -n <namespace>

# List deployments in a namespace
kubectl get deployments -n <namespace>

# Get detailed deployment info
kubectl describe deployment <deployment> -n <namespace>

# Get YAML of deployment
kubectl get deployment <deployment> -n <namespace> -o yaml
```

---

### 📜 Reading Logs

```bash
kubectl logs <pod_name> -n <namespace> --since=1h
kubectl logs <pod_name> -n <namespace> -c <container> --since=1h
kubectl logs deploy/<deployment> --since=5m
```

---

## 📊 Activity: Application Log Analysis

### Task Steps:
1. Create a directory:
   ```bash
   mkdir applogs && cd applogs
   ```

2. Backup logs:
   ```bash
   kubectl logs deploy/<deployment> --since=1h > apilogs-<current_datetime>
   ```

3. Create file `apilogs-aggregated`:
   ```
   heartbeats=100
   ExecutionReports=10
   canceled=2
   ```

4. Create a script `report.sh` to generate this report.

5. Append values to the same file:
   ```
   NotHeartBeats=300
   DBWarnings=15
   GOOG=4
   AAPL=3
   BUY=53
   SELL=23
   ```

6. BONUS:
   - Find unique stocks
   - Count logs per stock

## ✅ Activity 2: YAML Error Alerts

### Why Alerts?
FluxCD deploys YAML-based manifests. Errors in YAML files can block deployment.

To check for errors:
```bash
kubectl get kustomizations -A | grep <cohort-team-env>
```

---

### 🔍 Loki Query for YAML Errors

```loki
{job="flux-system/kustomize-controller"} |= `cohort` |= `team` |= `error`
```

---

### 🔔 Setup Automated Alerts via Microsoft Teams

1. Create a new Microsoft Team.
2. Create a webhook → copy URL.
3. In Grafana:
   - Create Folder: `c500team01`
   - Create Dashboard: `c500team01-alerts`
   - Add Panel:
     - **Name**: YAML Errors
     - **Query**:
       ```loki
       sum(
         count_over_time({job="flux-system/kustomize-controller"} |= `cohort` |= `team` |= `error`[1m])
         or vector(0)
       )
       ```

4. Add alert if count > 0, group: `cohort-team-yaml-errors`.
5. Create Contact Point in Grafana:
   - Select **Microsoft Teams**
   - Paste webhook URL

6. Create Notification Policy:
   - Match `grafana_folder=c500team01`
   - Link contact point

7. Test by adding YAML error to deployment and observe alert.

8. BONUS Panel: Add another panel with:
   ```loki
   {job="flux-system/kustomize-controller"} |= `cohort` |= `team` |= `error`
   ```

## ✅ Activity 3: Kubernetes Troubleshooting

### Objective
Simulate a broken deployment and restore it.

---

### 🔧 Steps

1. Navigate to directory:
   ```bash
   cd sre-course-infra/flux/apps/eks-sre-course/cXXX-team??-dev
   ```

2. Create a new branch:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b cXXXteam??
   ```

3. Introduce an error (e.g., change DB image):
   ```yaml
   image: "108174090253.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/production-support-course:notebook-dev-1"
   ```

4. Commit and Push:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "breaking image change"
   git push --set-upstream origin cXXXteam??
   ```

5. Create a Pull Request → Merge

6. Monitor Dashboard:
   - [https://k8sdashboard.computerlab.online](https://k8sdashboard.computerlab.online)

7. Troubleshoot:
   - Check namespace `cXXX-team??-dev`
   - View Workloads → Deployments → `orderbookdb`

8. Fix image:
   - Restore old image
   - Commit and push:
     ```bash
     git add .
     git commit -m "fixing image"
     git push
     ```

9. Confirm recovery via dashboard.
