# SQL

## Introduction
SQL (Structured Query Language) is a powerful tool used for managing and manipulating relational databases. This guide covers essential SQL concepts, including foreign keys, primary keys, candidate keys, ER diagrams, normalization, dependencies, and stored procedures.

## 1. Foreign Key
A **FOREIGN KEY** constraint prevents actions that would break relationships between tables. It references a **PRIMARY KEY** in another table.

Example:
```sql
CREATE TABLE Department (
    dept_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    dept_name VARCHAR(100)
);

CREATE TABLE Employee (
    emp_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    emp_name VARCHAR(100),
    dept_id INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (dept_id) REFERENCES Department(dept_id)
);
```

## 2. Primary Key
A **PRIMARY KEY** uniquely identifies each record in a table. It must contain **UNIQUE** values and **cannot** be NULL.

Example:
```sql
CREATE TABLE Students (
    student_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    student_name VARCHAR(100)
);
```

## 3. Candidate Key
A **Candidate Key** uniquely identifies a row and follows:
- **Uniqueness**
- **Minimality**
- **Stability**

Example:
```sql
CREATE TABLE Students (
    student_id INT,
    email VARCHAR(100),
    phone_number VARCHAR(15),
    PRIMARY KEY (student_id),
    UNIQUE (email, phone_number)
);
```

## 4. ER Diagram
An **Entity-Relationship (ER) Diagram** visually represents relationships between database tables.

**Entities**:
- **Strong Entity**: Exists independently, has a **Primary Key**.
- **Weak Entity**: Depends on a strong entity, has no **Primary Key**.

**Attributes**:
| Attribute Type | Description | Example |
|---------------|-------------|---------|
| **Key Attribute** | Uniquely identifies an entity | `student_id` |
| **Composite Attribute** | Contains multiple sub-attributes | `address (street, city, state)` |
| **Multivalued Attribute** | Can hold multiple values | `skills (Java, Python)` |
| **Derived Attribute** | Derived from another attribute | `age (from dob)` |

## 5. Normalization
Normalization reduces **redundancy** and improves **data integrity**.

| Normal Form | Description | Fix |
|------------|-------------|---------|
| **1NF** | No repeating values | Split into separate rows |
| **2NF** | No partial dependencies | Move dependent attributes |
| **3NF** | No transitive dependencies | Create a separate table |
| **BCNF** | Every determinant is a candidate key | Restructure table |

### Entities and their Attributes:

- **Bank Entity**: Attributes - Bank Name, Code, Address (Primary Key: Code)
- **Customer Entity**: Attributes - Customer_id, Name, Phone Number, Address (Primary Key: Customer_id)
- **Branch Entity**: Attributes - Branch_id, Name, Address (Primary Key: Branch_id)
- **Account Entity**: Attributes - Account_number, Account_Type, Balance (Primary Key: Account_number)
- **Loan Entity**: Attributes - Loan_id, Loan_Type, Amount (Primary Key: Loan_id)

### Relationships:

- **Bank has Branches (1:N)** - One Bank can have many Branches, but a Branch belongs to only one Bank.
- **Branch maintains Accounts (1:N)** - One Branch can have many Accounts, but an Account belongs to only one Branch.
- **Branch offers Loans (1:N)** - One Branch can offer multiple Loans, but a Loan belongs to only one Branch.
- **Account held by Customers (M:N)** - One Customer can have multiple Accounts, and an Account can belong to multiple Customers.
- **Loan availed by Customers (M:N)** - One Customer can have multiple Loans, and a Loan can be availed by multiple Customers.

## 6. Dependencies
1. **Functional Dependency**: One column determines another.
   ```sql
   emp_id â†’ emp_name
   ```
2. **Partial Dependency**: A non-key attribute depends on **part** of a composite key.
3. **Transitive Dependency**: A non-key attribute depends on another **non-key** attribute.
4. **Multivalued Dependency**: One attribute determines multiple values of another.
5. **Join Dependency**: A table can be split into multiple tables **without data loss**.

---

## 7. Stored Procedure
A **Stored Procedure** is precompiled SQL code stored in the database for reuse.

**Why use DELIMITER?**
- In SQL, the default statement separator is `;`.
- However, stored procedures contain multiple statements.
- Using `DELIMITER` helps define a **custom separator** to avoid conflicts.
- Once the procedure is created, `DELIMITER ;` resets it to default.

## Regular Query vs Stored Procedure

| Feature | Regular Queries | Stored Procedures (MySQL) |
|---------|---------------|------------------|
| **Execution** | Parsed, compiled, and executed every time | Precompiled and stored in the database |
| **Performance** | Slower due to repeated parsing and execution | Faster since it's precompiled |
| **Reusability** | Needs to be rewritten or resent each time | Can be executed multiple times with `CALL` |
| **Security** | Direct access to tables, prone to SQL injection | Can restrict access and prevent injection |
| **Network Traffic** | Entire query sent over the network | Only the procedure call is sent |
| **Maintainability** | Hard to maintain if query logic changes | Easy to modify in one place |
| **Transaction Handling** | Manual transaction handling needed | Supports `BEGIN`, `COMMIT`, `ROLLBACK` |


### Code Explanation:
```sql
DELIMITER //
CREATE PROCEDURE sp_insert_student(
    IN p_first_name VARCHAR(50),
    IN p_last_name VARCHAR(50),
    IN p_email VARCHAR(100)
)
BEGIN
    -- Insert new student record
    INSERT INTO students (first_name, last_name, email) 
    VALUES (p_first_name, p_last_name, p_email);
    
    -- Return the newly inserted Student ID
    SELECT LAST_INSERT_ID() AS STUDENT_ID;
END //
DELIMITER ;
```

**Explanation:**
1. `DELIMITER //` - Changes the default statement separator to `//` to allow multi-line statements inside the procedure.
2. `CREATE PROCEDURE sp_insert_student(...)` - Defines a stored procedure that takes three input parameters.
3. `BEGIN ... END` - Defines the body of the procedure.
4. `INSERT INTO students (...) VALUES (...)` - Inserts a new student record into the `students` table.
5. `SELECT LAST_INSERT_ID() AS STUDENT_ID;` - Retrieves the ID of the last inserted record.
6. `END //` - Marks the end of the procedure.
7. `DELIMITER ;` - Resets the delimiter back to `;`.

## 8. Practice Problems
1. Create a **Students** table with a **Foreign Key** reference to a **Courses** table.
2. Normalize an **Orders** table to **3NF**.
3. Implement a **Stored Procedure** to insert employee data.
