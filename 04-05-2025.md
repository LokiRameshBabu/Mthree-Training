## What is Docker?
Docker is an open-source platform that enables developers to build, ship, and run applications in isolated environments called containers. It provides a lightweight and consistent runtime environment, ensuring applications work seamlessly across different systems.

## Why Use Docker?
- **Portability**: Applications can run consistently across various environments.
- **Scalability**: Easily scale applications using container orchestration tools like Kubernetes.
- **Efficiency**: Reduces resource usage compared to traditional virtual machines.
- **Faster Deployment**: Allows rapid application development and deployment with pre-built images.
- **Isolation**: Each container runs independently, reducing dependency conflicts.

## Key Docker Concepts
### Containers
Containers are lightweight, standalone, and executable software packages that include everything needed to run an application (code, runtime, libraries, and dependencies). They ensure that software runs reliably when moved from one environment to another.

### Volumes
Volumes are storage mechanisms that allow persistent data to be maintained even when containers stop or restart. They are used to store data outside the container's filesystem.

### Runtime
Docker runtime is the component responsible for executing and managing containers. It ensures that containers run in an isolated and secure environment.

## Installation of Docker
### Installing Docker on Ubuntu
1. **Update the package list**
   ```sh
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt upgrade -y
   ```
2. **Install required dependencies**
   ```sh
   sudo apt install -y apt-transport-https ca-certificates curl software-properties-common
   ```
3. **Install Docker**
   ```sh
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install -y docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io
   ```
4. **Verify installation**
   ```sh
   docker --version
   ```

## Connecting Docker to an AWS Ubuntu EC2 Instance
1. **Launch an EC2 Instance**
   - Go to AWS Management Console
   - Select **EC2** â†’ **Launch Instance**
   - Choose **Ubuntu** as the AMI
   - Configure security groups to allow SSH (port 22)

2. **Connect to the EC2 Instance**
   ```sh
   ssh -i your-key.pem ubuntu@your-ec2-instance-ip
   ```

3. **Install Docker on EC2** (Follow the same steps as the Docker installation guide above)

4. **Enable Docker Service**
   ```sh
   sudo systemctl enable docker
   sudo systemctl start docker
   ```

5. **Run a Test Container**
   ```sh
   sudo docker run hello-world
   ```
