# Linux & AWS EC2 Guide

## 1. What is Linux?
**Linux** is an open-source, Unix-like operating system that manages hardware resources and provides an interface for users and applications. It is widely used in servers, cloud computing, embedded systems, and development environments.

### Features of Linux:
- **Open-Source** – Free to use and modify.
- **Secure** – Provides robust security features.
- **Multi-User & Multi-Tasking** – Supports multiple users and applications simultaneously.
- **Lightweight & Efficient** – Optimized for performance.
- **Customizable** – Offers various distributions like Ubuntu, CentOS, and Debian.

---

## 2. Why is Linux Used?
- **Server Management** – Powers most web servers and cloud environments.
- **Development** – Preferred OS for software and system programming.
- **Networking & Security** – Used for firewalls, network monitoring, and cybersecurity tools.
- **Automation & Scripting** – Supports shell scripting for automation tasks.
- **Cloud Computing** – Runs on platforms like AWS, Google Cloud, and Azure.

## 3. The Linux File System
The **Linux File System** organizes data and files in a hierarchical structure.

### Important Directories:
| Directory | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `/` | Root directory (top of the hierarchy) |
| `/home` | User home directories |
| `/bin` | Essential user binaries (commands) |
| `/etc` | Configuration files |
| `/var` | Log files and system data |
| `/usr` | Installed software and libraries |
| `/tmp` | Temporary files |
| `/dev` | Device files (USB, disks) |

## 4. Linux Command Line Interface (CLI)
The **CLI** allows users to interact with Linux through text-based commands.

- **Shell** – The command-line interface interpreter (e.g., Bash, Zsh, Fish).
- **Terminal Emulator** – Software like GNOME Terminal, Konsole, or PuTTY used to run shell commands.

## 5. Linux Basic Commands
| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `pwd` | Print current working directory |
| `ls` | List files in a directory |
| `cd` | Change directory |
| `mkdir` | Create a new directory |
| `rm -r` | Remove a file or directory |
| `cp` | Copy files or directories |
| `mv` | Move or rename files |
| `cat` | View file content |
| `chmod` | Change file permissions |
| `sudo` | Run command with superuser privileges |

## 6. How to Create an Account in AWS (Amazon Web Services)
1. Go to [AWS Website](https://aws.amazon.com/).
2. Click **Create an AWS Account**.
3. Enter your email, password, and AWS account name.
4. Provide billing information (AWS Free Tier is available).
5. Verify identity using phone or credit card.
6. Choose a support plan (Basic Support is free).
7. Sign in to the AWS Management Console.

## 7. How AWS EC2 Instances Work
Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) provides virtual servers in the cloud.

### Key Components:
- **AMI (Amazon Machine Image)** – A pre-configured OS for instances.
- **Instance Type** – Defines CPU, memory, and storage configurations.
- **Security Groups** – Firewall rules for instance access.
- **Elastic IPs** – Static public IPs assigned to instances.
- **Key Pair** – SSH key used for secure instance access.

## 8. How to Create an Event Using EC2
1. Log in to AWS Management Console.
2. Go to **EC2 Dashboard** > Click **Launch Instance**.
3. Select an AMI (e.g., Ubuntu, Amazon Linux).
4. Choose an instance type (e.g., t2.micro for Free Tier).
5. Configure instance details (network, IAM role, etc.).
6. Add storage (default 8GB for Free Tier).
7. Configure security group (allow SSH, HTTP, etc.).
8. Review and click **Launch**.
9. Select an existing key pair or create a new one.
10. Click **Launch Instance**.

## 9. How to Manage Regions in AWS
AWS provides multiple regions worldwide to host resources closer to users.

### Steps to Change AWS Region:
1. Log in to AWS Console.
2. Click the **Region Selector** at the top-right corner.
3. Choose a different region (e.g., US-East-1, EU-West-1).
4. All AWS services/resources in that region will be displayed.

**Tip:** Use regions closer to your users to reduce latency.

## 10. How to Connect to an AWS EC2 Instance
1. Open AWS EC2 Dashboard.
2. Select your running instance.
3. Click **Connect**.
4. Use SSH from a terminal:
```bash
ssh -i your-key.pem ec2-user@your-ec2-ip
```
5. If using PuTTY, convert `.pem` to `.ppk` format using PuTTYgen.
6. Once connected, run Linux commands inside the instance.

## 11. How to Write and Execute Code in AWS Linux
1. **Connect to EC2** via SSH.
2. **Create a script:**
   ```bash
   touch hello.sh
   nano hello.sh
   ```
3. **Write the script inside nano:**
   ```bash
   #!/bin/bash
   echo "Hello, AWS Linux!"
   ```
4. **Save and exit** (Press `CTRL+X`, then `Y`, then `ENTER`).
5. **Give execute permission:**
   ```bash
   chmod +x hello.sh
   ```
6. **Run the script:**
   ```bash
   ./hello.sh
   ```
   **Output:**
   ```
   Hello, AWS Linux!
   ```

## 12. How to Connect to an AWS EC2 Instance Using Git Bash
1. **Open Git Bash** on your local computer.
2. **Navigate to the directory** where your `.pem` key file is stored:
   ```bash
   cd path/to/your-key
   ```
3. **Connect to the EC2 instance using SSH:**
   ```bash
   ssh -i your-key.pem ec2-user@your-ec2-ip
   ```
4. If prompted, type **yes** to continue connecting.
5. You are now logged into your EC2 instance.
