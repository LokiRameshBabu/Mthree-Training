# SQL Guide

## Introduction
SQL (Structured Query Language) is a standard language used to manage and manipulate relational databases. This guide covers various SQL concepts, including bitwise operators, conditional statements, joins, ranking functions, and window functions.

## 1. SQL Bitwise Operators
SQL supports bitwise operations for performing bit-level manipulations.

| Operator | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `&` (AND) | Returns 1 if both bits are 1 | `0101 & 0011 = 0001 (1)` |
| <code>&#124;</code> (OR) | Returns 1 if at least one bit is 1 | `0101 \| 0011 = 0111 (7)` |
| `^` (XOR) | Returns 1 if bits are different | `0101 ^ 0011 = 0110 (6)` |

## 2. CASE WHEN Statements
Used for conditional logic in SQL, similar to IF-ELSE statements in programming.

### Syntax:
```sql
CASE  
    WHEN condition1 THEN result1 
    WHEN condition2 THEN result2 
    ELSE default_result 
END
```

### Example:
```sql
SELECT student_name, marks,
    CASE  
        WHEN marks >= 90 THEN 'A' 
        WHEN marks >= 75 THEN 'B' 
        WHEN marks >= 50 THEN 'C' 
        ELSE 'Fail' 
    END AS grade  
FROM students;
```

## 3. Bit Shifting Operations
Shifts the bits of a number left (`<<`) or right (`>>`).

| Operation | Description | Example |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| `<<` Left Shift | Multiplies by 2^N | `5 << 2 = 20` |
| `>>` Right Shift | Divides by 2^N | `20 >> 2 = 5` |

---

## 4. SQL Joins
Joins combine rows from two or more tables based on a related column.

### Example:
```sql
SELECT customers.name, orders.order_id 
FROM customers 
JOIN orders ON customers.customerID = orders.customerID;
```

---

## 5. RANK() and DENSE_RANK()
Used for ranking records within a dataset.

### Example:
```sql
SELECT name, department, salary,  
    RANK() OVER (ORDER BY salary DESC) AS SalaryRank,  
    DENSE_RANK() OVER (ORDER BY salary DESC) AS SalaryDenseRank  
FROM employees;
```

---

## 6. Partition By
Used to partition data within a result set before applying window functions.

### Example:
```sql
SELECT name, department, salary, 
    RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY department ORDER BY salary DESC) AS DepartmentRank 
FROM employees;
```

---

## 7. LEAD() and LAG()
Used for accessing subsequent or previous rows without a self-join.

### Example (LEAD):
```sql
SELECT emp_id, name, salary,  
    LEAD(salary) OVER (ORDER BY emp_id) AS next_salary 
FROM employees;
```

### Example (LAG):
```sql
SELECT emp_id, name, salary,  
    LAG(salary) OVER (ORDER BY emp_id) AS previous_salary 
FROM employees;
```

## 8. Practice Problems
1. Find the names and cities of customers from Canada and the USA.
2. Classify customers into 'Premium', 'Gold', or 'Standard' based on their credit limit.
3. Retrieve a list of distinct order statuses from the Orders table.
