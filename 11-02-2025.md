# SQL

## Introduction
SQL (Structured Query Language) is a standard language used to manage and manipulate relational databases. This guide covers various SQL concepts, including bitwise operators, conditional statements, joins, ranking functions, and window functions.

---

## 1. SQL Bitwise Operators
SQL supports bitwise operations for performing bit-level manipulations.

| Operator | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `&` (AND) | Returns 1 if both bits are 1 | `0101 & 0011 = 0001 (1)` |
| <code>&#124;</code> (OR) | Returns 1 if at least one bit is 1 | `0101 \| 0011 = 0111 (7)` |
| `^` (XOR) | Returns 1 if bits are different | `0101 ^ 0011 = 0110 (6)` |

---

## 2. CASE WHEN Statements
Used for conditional logic in SQL, similar to IF-ELSE statements in programming.

### Syntax:
```sql
CASE  
    WHEN condition1 THEN result1 
    WHEN condition2 THEN result2 
    ELSE default_result 
END
```

### Example:
```sql
SELECT student_name, marks,
    CASE  
        WHEN marks >= 90 THEN 'A' 
        WHEN marks >= 75 THEN 'B' 
        WHEN marks >= 50 THEN 'C' 
        ELSE 'Fail' 
    END AS grade  
FROM students;
```

---

## 3. Bit Shifting Operations
Shifts the bits of a number left (`<<`) or right (`>>`).

| Operation | Description | Example |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| `<<` Left Shift | Multiplies by 2^N | `5 << 2 = 20` |
| `>>` Right Shift | Divides by 2^N | `20 >> 2 = 5` |

## 4. SQL Joins
## Introduction
SQL Joins are used to combine data from two or more tables based on a related column. Joins allow querying multiple tables efficiently by leveraging relationships between them.

### Types of Joins:
1. **INNER JOIN** – Returns only matching records.
2. **LEFT JOIN (LEFT OUTER JOIN)** – Returns all records from the left table and matching records from the right.
3. **RIGHT JOIN (RIGHT OUTER JOIN)** – Returns all records from the right table and matching records from the left.
4. **FULL JOIN (FULL OUTER JOIN)** – Returns all records when there is a match in either table.
5. **CROSS JOIN** – Returns the Cartesian product of two tables.
6. **SELF JOIN** – Joins a table to itself.

---

## 4.1. INNER JOIN
Returns only the rows where there is a match in both tables.

### Example:
```sql
SELECT employees.emp_id, employees.name, department.dept_name
FROM employees
INNER JOIN department ON employees.dept_id = department.dept_id;
```
### Output:
| emp_id | name   | dept_name |
|--------|--------|-----------|
| 101    | John   | HR        |
| 102    | Alice  | IT        |
| 103    | Bob    | Finance   |

---

## 4.2. LEFT JOIN (LEFT OUTER JOIN)
Returns all records from the left table and matching records from the right table. If no match is found, NULL is returned for the right table's columns.

### Example:
```sql
SELECT employees.emp_id, employees.name, department.dept_name
FROM employees
LEFT JOIN department ON employees.dept_id = department.dept_id;
```
### Output:
| emp_id | name   | dept_name |
|--------|--------|-----------|
| 101    | John   | HR        |
| 102    | Alice  | IT        |
| 104    | Mark   | NULL      |

---

## 4.3. RIGHT JOIN (RIGHT OUTER JOIN)
Returns all records from the right table and matching records from the left table. If no match is found, NULL is returned for the left table's columns.

### Example:
```sql
SELECT employees.emp_id, employees.name, department.dept_name
FROM employees
RIGHT JOIN department ON employees.dept_id = department.dept_id;
```
### Output:
| emp_id | name   | dept_name |
|--------|--------|-----------|
| 101    | John   | HR        |
| 102    | Alice  | IT        |
| NULL   | NULL   | Marketing |

---

## 4.4. FULL JOIN (FULL OUTER JOIN)
Returns all records when there is a match in either table. If there is no match, NULL is returned for missing values from either table.

### Example:
```sql
SELECT employees.emp_id, employees.name, department.dept_name
FROM employees
FULL OUTER JOIN department ON employees.dept_id = department.dept_id;
```
### Output:
| emp_id | name   | dept_name |
|--------|--------|-----------|
| 101    | John   | HR        |
| 102    | Alice  | IT        |
| 104    | Mark   | NULL      |
| NULL   | NULL   | Marketing |

---

## 4.5. CROSS JOIN
Returns the Cartesian product of two tables, meaning every row from the first table is combined with every row from the second table.

### Example:
```sql
SELECT employees.name, department.dept_name
FROM employees
CROSS JOIN department;
```
### Output:
| name   | dept_name |
|--------|-----------|
| John   | HR        |
| John   | IT        |
| John   | Finance   |
| Alice  | HR        |
| Alice  | IT        |
| Alice  | Finance   |

---

## 4.6. SELF JOIN
A self join is when a table is joined with itself. This is useful for hierarchical relationships such as employees and managers.

### Example:
```sql
SELECT e1.name AS Employee, e2.name AS Manager
FROM employees e1
JOIN employees e2 ON e1.manager_id = e2.emp_id;
```
### Output:
| Employee | Manager  |
|----------|---------|
| Alice    | John    |
| Bob      | Alice   |
| Mark     | Bob     |

---

## Summary Table
| Join Type | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **INNER JOIN** | Returns only matching rows from both tables |
| **LEFT JOIN** | Returns all rows from the left table and matching rows from the right table |
| **RIGHT JOIN** | Returns all rows from the right table and matching rows from the left table |
| **FULL JOIN** | Returns all rows when there is a match in either table |
| **CROSS JOIN** | Returns the Cartesian product of two tables |
| **SELF JOIN** | Joins a table to itself |

---

# Common Window Functions:
1. **RANK()** – Assigns a unique rank to each row based on an order.
2. **DENSE_RANK()** – Similar to RANK() but without gaps in ranking.
3. **PARTITION BY** – Groups data into partitions before applying window functions.
4. **LEAD()** – Accesses the next row's value.
5. **LAG()** – Accesses the previous row's value.

---

## 1. RANK() and DENSE_RANK()
Used for ranking records within a dataset.

### Example:
```sql
SELECT name, department, salary,  
    RANK() OVER (ORDER BY salary DESC) AS SalaryRank,  
    DENSE_RANK() OVER (ORDER BY salary DESC) AS SalaryDenseRank  
FROM employees;
```
### Output:
| name  | department | salary | SalaryRank | SalaryDenseRank |
|-------|------------|--------|------------|----------------|
| Alice | IT        | 90000  | 1          | 1              |
| Bob   | HR        | 75000  | 2          | 2              |
| John  | IT        | 75000  | 2          | 2              |
| Mark  | Finance   | 50000  | 4          | 3              |

---

## 2. Partition By
Used to partition data within a result set before applying window functions.

### Example:
```sql
SELECT name, department, salary, 
    RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY department ORDER BY salary DESC) AS DepartmentRank 
FROM employees;
```
### Output:
| name  | department | salary | DepartmentRank |
|-------|------------|--------|----------------|
| Alice | IT        | 90000  | 1              |
| John  | IT        | 75000  | 2              |
| Bob   | HR        | 75000  | 1              |
| Mark  | Finance   | 50000  | 1              |

---

## 3. LEAD() and LAG()
Used for accessing subsequent or previous rows without a self-join.

### Example (LEAD):
```sql
SELECT emp_id, name, salary,  
    LEAD(salary) OVER (ORDER BY emp_id) AS next_salary 
FROM employees;
```
### Output:
| emp_id | name  | salary | next_salary |
|--------|-------|--------|-------------|
| 101    | Alice | 90000  | 75000       |
| 102    | Bob   | 75000  | 75000       |
| 103    | John  | 75000  | 50000       |
| 104    | Mark  | 50000  | NULL        |

### Example (LAG):
```sql
SELECT emp_id, name, salary,  
    LAG(salary) OVER (ORDER BY emp_id) AS previous_salary 
FROM employees;
```
### Output:
| emp_id | name  | salary | previous_salary |
|--------|-------|--------|----------------|
| 101    | Alice | 90000  | NULL           |
| 102    | Bob   | 75000  | 90000          |
| 103    | John  | 75000  | 75000          |
| 104    | Mark  | 50000  | 75000          |
