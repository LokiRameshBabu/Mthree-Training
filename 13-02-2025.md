# SQL

## Introduction
In relational databases, **foreign keys** establish relationships between tables, ensuring referential integrity. SQL provides different **ON DELETE** and **ON UPDATE** actions to define behaviors when referenced data is deleted or updated.

### 1. ON DELETE CASCADE
When a parent record is deleted, all associated child records in the referencing table are also deleted.

#### Example:
```sql
CREATE TABLE Department (
    dept_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    dept_name VARCHAR(100)
);

CREATE TABLE Employee (
    emp_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    emp_name VARCHAR(100),
    dept_id INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (dept_id) REFERENCES Department(dept_id) ON DELETE CASCADE
);
```
#### Behavior:
- If a department is deleted from `Department`, all employees belonging to that department in `Employee` are also deleted.

#### Execution:
```sql
DELETE FROM Department WHERE dept_id = 101;
```
#### Effect:
- Deletes the department **dept_id = 101**.
- Automatically removes all employees having **dept_id = 101**.

---

### 2. ON DELETE SET NULL
When a parent record is deleted, the foreign key values in the child table are set to **NULL**.

#### Example:
```sql
CREATE TABLE Employee (
    emp_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    emp_name VARCHAR(100),
    dept_id INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (dept_id) REFERENCES Department(dept_id) ON DELETE SET NULL
);
```
#### Behavior:
- If a department is deleted from `Department`, all associated employees in `Employee` will have `dept_id` set to **NULL**.

#### Execution:
```sql
DELETE FROM Department WHERE dept_id = 102;
```
#### Effect:
- Deletes the department **dept_id = 102**.
- Updates `Employee` table by setting **dept_id = NULL** where `dept_id = 102`.

---

### 3. ON UPDATE CASCADE
When a parent record's **primary key** is updated, the corresponding foreign keys in child records are also updated.

#### Example:
```sql
CREATE TABLE Employee (
    emp_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    emp_name VARCHAR(100),
    dept_id INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (dept_id) REFERENCES Department(dept_id) ON UPDATE CASCADE
);
```
#### Behavior:
- If a department's `dept_id` is updated, the corresponding `dept_id` in the `Employee` table is also updated.

#### Execution:
```sql
UPDATE Department SET dept_id = 200 WHERE dept_id = 103;
```
#### Effect:
- Updates `dept_id = 103` to `200` in `Department`.
- Automatically updates all `dept_id` values from **103 â†’ 200** in `Employee`.

## String Concatenation in SQL
### Using `CONCAT` to Generate Insert Statements
SQL provides the `CONCAT` function to join multiple strings into a single string. This can be useful when dynamically generating SQL statements.

#### Example:
```sql
SELECT CONCAT(
    'INSERT INTO employees (emp_id, name, salary, department) VALUES (',
    emp_id, ', ',
    QUOTE(name), ', ',
    salary, ', ',
    QUOTE(department), ');'
) AS insert_statement
FROM source_employees;
```
#### Explanation:
- The `CONCAT` function joins multiple strings together.
- `QUOTE(name)` ensures that string values are properly enclosed in quotes.
- The output generates dynamic `INSERT` statements based on existing table data.

#### Sample Output:
```sql
INSERT INTO employees (emp_id, name, salary, department) VALUES (101, 'John Doe', 60000, 'HR');
INSERT INTO employees (emp_id, name, salary, department) VALUES (102, 'Jane Smith', 75000, 'IT');
```

This method is useful for **data migration** or **script generation** from existing data.

## Transactions
Before we jump into ACID, we need to understand database transactions. A relational database allows the following actions:

- Read existing data
- Insert new data
- Update existing data
- Delete existing data
- Add or alter schema (tables and relationships)

A **transaction** is a set of one or more actions that represents a single, logical unit of work. For example:

- Reserving three rooms at a hotel should either book all rooms or none at all.
- Purchasing a concert ticket requires finding an available ticket and holding it until payment is completed.

Without transactions, data inconsistencies like double bookings or orphaned records can occur.

## ACID Properties
ACID is an acronym for:

- **Atomicity**
- **Consistency**
- **Isolation**
- **Durability**

### 1. Atomicity
Ensures that a transaction follows the "all or nothing" rule. If one action in the transaction fails, the entire transaction fails.

Example:
```sql
START TRANSACTION;
INSERT INTO accounts (user_id, balance) VALUES (1, 500);
UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance - 200 WHERE user_id = 1;
COMMIT;
```
If an error occurs before `COMMIT`, the transaction is rolled back.

### 2. Consistency
Ensures that a transaction moves the database from one valid state to another.

Example:
- Enforcing primary and foreign key constraints to prevent orphaned records.
- Rejecting transactions that would create invalid data.

### 3. Isolation
Ensures that transactions do not interfere with each other.

| Isolation Level | Description |
|---------------|-------------|
| **Serializable** | Transactions are fully isolated, preventing dirty reads. |
| **Read Uncommitted** | Transactions can see uncommitted changes (dirty reads). |

Example:
```sql
SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL SERIALIZABLE;
START TRANSACTION;
UPDATE orders SET status = 'Processing' WHERE order_id = 10;
COMMIT;
```

### 4. Durability
Ensures that once a transaction is committed, it remains saved even after system failures.

Example:
- Database logs changes before committing.
- Recovery mechanisms ensure committed transactions persist.

## Summary Table
| Constraint | Effect on Child Table When Parent Changes |
|------------|----------------------------------|
| **ON DELETE CASCADE** | Deletes associated child rows |
| **ON DELETE SET NULL** | Sets foreign key to NULL |
| **ON UPDATE CASCADE** | Updates foreign key values |

---

## Practice Problems
1. Create a `Courses` table with an `ON DELETE CASCADE` reference in the `Students` table.
2. Implement `ON DELETE SET NULL` in a `Projects` table linked to an `Employees` table.
3. Update a foreign key using `ON UPDATE CASCADE` and observe the behavior.
4. Implement a transaction that ensures funds transfer between accounts follows ACID principles.
