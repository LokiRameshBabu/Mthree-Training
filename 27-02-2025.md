# Linux Security Guide

## 1. Introduction
Linux security is essential to ensure system integrity, data protection, and secure access control. This guide covers key security practices, tools, and configurations.

---

## 2. Why Do We Need Security?
Security is crucial to protect Linux systems from:
- Unauthorized access
- Data breaches
- Malware and cyberattacks
- System vulnerabilities

---

## 3. Security Requirements
To enhance security, consider implementing:
- Strong authentication mechanisms
- Regular system updates
- Firewalls and network security policies
- Access controls and permissions

---

## 4. Sudo Configuration and Usage
`sudo` allows users to execute privileged commands without logging in as root.

### **Configuration**
Edit the sudoers file safely using:
```bash
sudo visudo
```
- Grant sudo access to a user:
```bash
username ALL=(ALL) ALL
```

### **Usage**
- Run a command as root:
```bash
sudo command
```
- Switch to root user:
```bash
sudo -i
```

---

## 5. User Passwords and Aging Policies
To set or change passwords:
```bash
passwd username
```
To configure password aging:
```bash
chage -l username  # View password expiry details
chage -M 90 username  # Set max password age to 90 days
```

---

## 6. Shadow Passwords
Linux stores encrypted passwords in `/etc/shadow`. This file enhances security by restricting direct access to password hashes.

To view shadow file:
```bash
sudo cat /etc/shadow
```

---

## 7. Understanding SSH (Secure Shell)
SSH allows secure remote access to Linux systems.

### **Enable SSH**
```bash
sudo systemctl enable sshd
sudo systemctl start sshd
```
### **Connect to a Remote Server**
```bash
ssh user@remote-server
```

---

## 8. Logging and Monitoring Services
Use `journalctl` for system logs:
```bash
sudo journalctl -xe
```
To view real-time logs:
```bash
tail -f /var/log/syslog
```

---

## 9. SELinux Configuration
SELinux enhances security by enforcing mandatory access controls.
- Check SELinux status:
```bash
sestatus
```
- Change SELinux mode:
```bash
sudo setenforce 1  # Enable enforcing mode
sudo setenforce 0  # Set permissive mode
```

---

## 10. Firewalls in Linux
Linux systems use `firewalld` or `iptables` for network security.
### **Enable and Configure Firewalld**
```bash
sudo systemctl start firewalld
sudo firewall-cmd --add-port=22/tcp --permanent
sudo firewall-cmd --reload
```

---

## 11. Firewall Chain Rules: Input, Output, and Forward
Firewalls manage network traffic using chains in `iptables`. The three main chains are:

### **1. INPUT Chain**
- Handles incoming traffic directed to the local system.
- Example: Allow SSH connections on port 22:
  ```bash
  sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 22 -j ACCEPT
  ```

### **2. OUTPUT Chain**
- Manages outbound traffic originating from the local system.
- Example: Allow outgoing HTTP requests:
  ```bash
  sudo iptables -A OUTPUT -p tcp --dport 80 -j ACCEPT
  ```

### **3. FORWARD Chain**
- Deals with packets that pass through the system (used in routing or NAT).
- Example: Allow forwarding packets for a specific subnet:
  ```bash
  sudo iptables -A FORWARD -s 192.168.1.0/24 -j ACCEPT
  ```

To list current firewall rules:
```bash
sudo iptables -L -v
```

To delete a rule:
```bash
sudo iptables -D INPUT -p tcp --dport 22 -j ACCEPT
```

To save firewall rules:
```bash
sudo iptables-save > /etc/iptables/rules.v4
```

To reload firewall rules:
```bash
sudo iptables-restore < /etc/iptables/rules.v4
```

---

## 12. Implementing File Servers (FTP & NFS)
### **Install and Configure FTP**
```bash
sudo dnf install vsftpd -y
sudo systemctl enable vsftpd
```
### **Install and Configure NFS**
```bash
sudo dnf install nfs-utils -y
sudo systemctl enable nfs-server
```

---

## 13. Types of System Attacks
Common threats include:
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** Overloading system resources
- **Brute Force Attacks:** Repeated login attempts
- **Privilege Escalation:** Exploiting vulnerabilities to gain root access

---

## 14. Network Security & Protocols
Network security best practices include:
- Enabling firewalls
- Using secure SSH keys for authentication
- Monitoring network traffic with:
```bash
sudo netstat -tulpn
```

---

## 15. Testing for Security
Security testing ensures vulnerabilities are identified and mitigated.
### **Common Tools**
- `nmap` - Scans open ports:
```bash
nmap -A target-ip
```
- `fail2ban` - Prevents brute force attacks:
```bash
sudo systemctl enable fail2ban
```
